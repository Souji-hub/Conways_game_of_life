# Game of Life Simulation

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway, where each cell in a grid evolves based on a set of rules.

## Features

- Random initialization of the grid with live cells.
- Visualization of the grid using Pygame for each generation.
- Implementation of the standard rules of the Game of Life.
- Clearing the terminal screen between generations for a clean display.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (install using `pip install pygame`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-of-life.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd game-of-life

3. Run the Script

    python game_of_life_pygame.py

4. Adjust the simulation parameters in the script (rows, cols, generations, etc.) to customize the simulation.


## Configuration
rows: Number of rows in the grid.
cols: Number of columns in the grid.
generations: Number of generations (iterations) for the simulation.
density: Density of live cells when initializing the grid.
delay: Time delay (in seconds) between generations for visualization.
cell_size: Size of each cell in pixels.
